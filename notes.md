## Getting AWS Instance Running

Launching a Ubuntu server to launch R-Shiny Server, we first must create an instance. We will do this by visiting AWS's website. We will search for the service labeled **EC2**. EC2 is Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud, which is allows users to rent virtual computers to run our own applications.

Going into this panel,  find "Instances"
![Instance in AWS](/media/instance.png)

After this, find "Launch instances" in the upper-right-hand corner.

On the Instances page we see that there is a server name "R-SERVER," and that it is running. When we create an instance we will see it show on this page.
